# Memory Game
 
Welcome to the Memory Game! This is a classic card-matching game designed to test and improve your memory skills. The objective is to find all matching pairs of cards within the shortest time and with the fewest moves.

## How to Play

1. **Game Setup:**
   - The game board consists of a grid of face-down cards.
   - The cards are shuffled, and their faces are hidden from view.

2. **Game Mechanics:**
   - On each turn, you can flip over two cards.
   - Click on a card to reveal its face.
   - If the two cards you've flipped match, they will remain face-up, and you've found a pair.
   - If they don't match, they will be flipped face-down again.

3. **Objective:**
   - Your goal is to find all matching pairs of cards.
   - The game ends when all pairs are found, and all cards are face-up.

4. **Restarting the Game:**
   - You can restart the game at any time to challenge yourself or try to beat your previous scores.
